# film-predictions
##### here i am trying to predict how many stars i would give to a movie... (it's pretty hard)

I use letterboxd.com to track the films I've seen and find new ones to watch. It's great.
I even have a star rating for *every film I've **ever** seen*. Having access to this kind of data is quite exciting.
This project is me trying to make use of that data. (again. I've played with it a couple times but this time I'm serious-er)
I'm also trying to practice some of the stuff I learned studying Data Science with Lambda School.
Specifically, I want work within a database rather than with .csv's, serialize a predictive model for use in an application, and deploy it so anyone can interact with it.
I'll update this readme as I progress. So far I have a populated database and a (pickled) model.
